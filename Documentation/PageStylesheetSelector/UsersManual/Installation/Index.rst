Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The installation of this extension is very simple. Just connect to the
TYPO3 Extension Repository and download «Page StyleSheet Selector»
(css\_select), located in the backend section.

From the extension manager, you'll be able to specify the directory
where you will store your CSS files (you must manually create this
folder). By default, it's fileadmin/css/. Note that you can specify
multiple directories, by separating them by a comma. Specified paths
are relative to the TYPO3 site path.

You can also choose from here the allowed extensions for the CSS
files.

If you keep your CSS files in sub-directories, you can also get them
by enabling the third option.
